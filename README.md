# Comprehensive Wine Classification Project with Naive Bayes
Classified wines into 3 categories using sklearn's Wine dataset. Split data, trained Gaussian and Multinomial classifiers, and evaluated performance. The notebook provides insights into the better-performing model and showcases predictions on test data.

# Project Overview:

This project delves into the intricate task of classifying wines into three categories using the renowned Wine dataset from sklearn.datasets. The primary objectives include data loading, splitting into test and train sets, model training with both Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) classifiers, and an extensive performance evaluation.

# Data Handling:
The Wine dataset, a benchmark for wine classification tasks, is harnessed for its rich feature set. The dataset is systematically loaded, featuring various attributes related to wine characteristics. Subsequently, the data is divided into training and testing sets, ensuring an unbiased assessment of the model performance.

# Model Training:
Two distinct Naive Bayes classifiers, Gaussian and Multinomial, are employed for the wine classification task. Gaussian Naive Bayes is chosen for its suitability with continuous data, while Multinomial Naive Bayes is selected to handle discrete data. Both models undergo rigorous training on the training set, capturing the intricate patterns inherent in the wine dataset.

# Performance Evaluation:
The models are rigorously evaluated based on their accuracy scores, providing a nuanced understanding of their effectiveness in categorizing wines. The predictions generated by both GNB and MNB models are compared against the true labels in the test set, offering a comprehensive view of their classification prowess.

# Results and Conclusions:
Upon meticulous evaluation, Gaussian Naive Bayes demonstrates an impressive accuracy of 100%, indicating perfect classification on the test set. In contrast, Multinomial Naive Bayes achieves a commendable accuracy of 88.89%. The final verdict, based on superior accuracy, declares Gaussian Naive Bayes as the more adept model for wine classification.

# Future Considerations:

While this project showcases the supremacy of Gaussian Naive Bayes, it opens avenues for further exploration. Future enhancements could involve hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, or experimenting with alternative classifiers to refine wine classification accuracy even further.
